This README if for Compuational Physics Homework Assignment 1

The scope of this README is to cover compliation and running of HW1

Untar rooney.tar with the command: 

tar xf rooney.tar rooney/

Inside the folder will be a file called HW1.c assuming you are using the standard GNU/linux toolchain the following command should be given to compile the program:

HW1.c -o HW1 -lm

This will create an executable file HW1.

HW1 requires 7 arguments to run.

The Inital conditions required are A_x, A_y, phi_x and phi_y.

Additionally you must provide the Omega_x and Omega_y. These are determined by the sqrt(k_x/mass_x) and sqrt(k_y/mass_y) of the system being modeled.

Lastly you must provide N, the number of points you want to plot per phase.

The program will plot t=0 to t = 50/Omega_min if Omega_x != Omega_y. 

Otherwise if Omega_x is equal to Omega_y then the program will plot one full phase of the occilation.

An example command would be:

./HW1 1 2 0 0.7853975 1 1 100

After executing the code a file named cor.txt will be generated, this text fill will contain a list of x and y coordinate pairs seperated by a space, with each pair on a new line.
