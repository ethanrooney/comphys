To compile integral2.c 

gcc integral2.c -o integral -lm

to run give 5 arguments: x_0, v0_y, v0_x, dt, t_max
Example below:

./integral2 1, 6.283185, 0, .01, 1

The above command places an object at 1 AU from the sun at coordiantes (1,0), sets it in motion at 2*pi in the positive y direction, then uses a time step of 1/100 of a year, and returns values for 1 year.

Interpreting the output:

The output is 7 values corisponding to: time, v_x, v_y, x, y, orbital energy, radius, potential energy, kinetic energy
