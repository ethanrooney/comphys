This code assignment is comprised of multiple components the main function is located in a file called nbody.c. However the source code calls a generalized rk2 integration function written in the file called rk2.c. Because we are calling another function this way, a header file is required, this header file lets the compiler know what to expect from the rk2 integrator.

To compile the code use the following commands while in the rooney directory.

gcc -c rk2.c

gcc -o nbody nbody.c -lm rk2.o 



The first command compiles the rk2.c file to an object file. The second command compiles nbody.c to a program nbody, and links the program to the math library and the rk2.o object made by the first file.

The program take inputs for 3 bodies in the following order:

dt Tmax m0 x0 y0 vx0 vy0 m1 x1 y1 vx1 vy1 m2 x2 y2 vx2 vy2


Bellow is a test command for an earth like object 

./nbody 0.01 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.0000001 1 0 0 6.283185 0.00000 0 0 0 0

The program the returns the following info:

time x0 y0 x1 y1 x2 y2 vx0 vy0 vx1 vy1 vx2 vy2
